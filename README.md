Case and Source of code: Causal Inference for The Brave and True https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/landing-page.html



Causal inference * double machine learning 


background

Observed data has bias

That means , there is feature X not also affecting Outcome Y, but also affecting treatment T.

So, before doing the causal inference, we need to do something that will let treatment T is independent from feature X. → that means : the observed data is from Randomized Controlled Trials, RCT

As a result, we can use the ‘Conditional Average Treatment Effect' CATE for the evaluation
